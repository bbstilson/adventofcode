# Advent of Code 2018

This repo is a collection of prompts, inputs, and solutions I produced for the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/) event.

I had dabbled in learning Haskell in the past, but never made it too far. This holiday season, I decided to try and learn Haskell and complete as many of the advent challenges as I could.
